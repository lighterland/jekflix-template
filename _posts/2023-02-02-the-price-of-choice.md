A data analyst should have the skills to perform comprehensive analysis, covering tasks such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and regression analysis. These analyses lead to valuable insights and business recommendations. In the [RevoU course](http://rebrand.ly/damc-grad-rf?refcode=erladana), I had the opportunity to demonstrate these skills in a project, which further enhanced my proficiency in using spreadsheets as a data analyst.

> This project was completed as part of the assignment for the RevoU Full Stack Data Analytics course.

## Business understanding

### Background

The ABC Company, a property listing company in Malaysia, aims to offer users and tenants a wide range of property choices while maximizing their profits. They adopt a 20% joint-profit sharing model, where properties with higher prices generate a greater percentage of revenue. **However, selling high-priced properties with numerous rooms or large sizes can be difficult.** <!-- challenging for this model's effectiveness. -->

### Dataset overview

The dataset contains 5000 property listings in Malaysia. You can access the spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR6J-ElvUyQd5sLsoi1EKRK2KdleCDVZZKOYYKIRe4TTVVSjDMKERoJdb3kewQPoF9kHaqjVT2sO6aq/pubhtml), which includes the datasets, data dictionary, and analysis results.
Numerical variables, like `size`, `rooms`, `bathrooms`, and `car parks`, provide insights through descriptive and inferential statistics. They help us understand the overall size of properties, which can be valuable information for properties that may be challenging to sell.
On the other hand, categorical variables such as `location`, `property type`, `property character`, and `furnishing` focus on gaining insights into demand based on location and characteristics. These insights can be particularly helpful in selling high-priced properties **because certain locations or property types, such as strategic areas or those with high land values, may make users and tenants willing to compromise on size or number of rooms.**

## Key ideas

To effectively analyze the data, there are a few key steps to follow:
1. Data cleaning
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Statistical measurements
4. Recommendations

## Cleaning up the data

First, it's essential to clean up the data, ensuring its quality and removing any inconsistencies.

## Exploratory data analysis

Next, performing EDA helps uncover insights about the properties and their price distribution, enabling classification into two categories: **luxury properties**, which belong to the higher price range (Q3-Q4), and **affordable properties**, which fall within the lower price range (Q1-Q2).
