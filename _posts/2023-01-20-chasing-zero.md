During my study in the [RevoU course](http://rebrand.ly/damc-grad-rf?refcode=erladana), I have been given an assignment to assess a critical aspect of data analysis, which is **understanding business problems**. The assignment is intended to enhance my analytical thinking and proficiency in identifying business problems, and is inspired by a real case study from a top-notch company.

> This project was completed as part of the assignment for the RevoU Full Stack Data Analytics course.

As a disclaimer, the analysis on this project is based on assumptions and uses the provided data only for an overview of possible metrics to provide, with no need for technical data processing.

## Business background

The company XYZ Ltd, which employs 4000 people, is facing a significant issue with its annual attrition rate of 15%, resulting in numerous open positions that need to be filled with new hires. The CHRO has requested the data analytics team to determine what factors should be prioritized in order to decrease the attrition rate by next year.

### Data

The datasets and data dictionary related to this case study are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FRgI1jwWOmc-yUM2fdxeTeNXDT7WO4MU?usp=share_link) for reference purpose.

## DARCI

I need to define the DARCI framework in order to establish clear expectations for each stakeholder's role in this project.

* The **decider** is the *Chief Human Resource Officer.*
* The **accountable** person is the *Head of Data.*
* The **responsible** parties consist of the *Data Analyst Team and HR Associate.*
* Those who are **consulted** include the *Human Resource Team, Business Development Team, Marketing Team, and Engineering Team.*
* Those who are **informed** consist of the *COO, CMO, CDO, CTO, Business Operations Team, Product Team, BD Associate, Marketing Associate, and Engineers.*

## Problem statement

Once the roles have been assigned, I need to clarify the problem to be solved by stating the problem statement using **SMART**, as follows:

*"How to reduce the employee attrition rate from 15% per year to 10% within the next year by analyzing the data and implementing appropriate strategies?"*

## Objective

Then I include the following objective to ensure clarity and establish the project's goal.

*"To identify the factors that contribute to employee attrition and implement strategies to reduce the attrition rate from 15% to 10% within a year."*

## Issue tree

To find the **root cause** of the problem, I use an issue tree to pinpoint and eliminate its underlying cause.

All potential root causes identified in the issue tree are based on assumptions. In reality, to confirm their impact on the problem, testing with data and statistical methods is necessary.

## Hypotheses and metrics

After identifying all the root causes from the issue tree, I create hypotheses with priority based on their impact on the problem statement. I then focus on the hypotheses with high priority and propose key metric recommendations based on those hypotheses to monitor the attrition rate's performance.

* **Lower salary**<br>If employees receive a higher salary than they currently do, then it will reduce job dissatisfaction and potentially reduce the attrition rate to 10% within a year.<br>**Priority:** *Medium*
* **Lack of advancement**<br>If employees receive more recognition and advancement opportunities, then it will lead them to feel more valued and motivated which could result in an increase in job satisfaction.<br>**Priority:** *Medium*
* **Culture clash**<br>If the company addresses and resolves employee culture clashes or conflicts by placing employees in departments where they have a better cultural fit, then it will improve the environment satisfaction.<br>**Priority:** *High*<br>**Metric:** *1)* [*Voluntary employee turnover rate*](https://www.aihr.com/blog/employee-engagement-metrics/#Turnover)—measures the rate at which employees are leaving the company voluntarily, indicating how satisfied employees are with the company's culture; *2)* [*Employee satisfaction*](https://www.aihr.com/blog/11-key-hr-metrics/)—measures the level of employee commitment have towards the company and this can be influenced by the work environment and culture within the company.
* **Heavy workload**<br>If a company can assess the workload of its employees and identify the specific tasks or projects that are causing the most strain, then it will create a better balance between work and life for those employees.<br>**Priority:** *High*<br>**Metric:** [*Absenteeism rate*](https://www.aihr.com/blog/employee-satisfaction-metrics/)—measures the rate at which employees are absent from work, indicating the level of stress or burnout they may be experiencing due to an unbalanced workload. A lower absenteeism rate suggests that employees are able to manage their workload and maintain a healthier work-life balance.
* **Long distance**<br>If the company allows for remote work or provides housing options closer to the workplace, then it will improve the work-life balance of its employees.<br>**Priority:** *Low*
* **Lack of motivation**<br>If the company improves job design to make roles more challenging and meaningful, then it will increase employee motivation and job involvement.<br>**Priority:** *Low*
* **Lack of training**<br>If employees are provided with more training and development opportunities, then it will increase the employee performance.<br>**Priority:** *High*<br>**Metric:** *1)* [*Employee performance post-training*](https://www.aihr.com/blog/training-metrics/)—measures the overall performance of employees after they have completed training and development opportunities. It can be compared to their performance before training to determine if there is an improvement; *2)* [*Work efficiency*](https://www.aihr.com/blog/employee-performance-metrics/#WorkEfficiency)—measures the productivity of employees in terms of the amount of work completed in a specific period of time, and it measures the employee's productivity after the training.

Please note that in reality, all the root causes must be proven through hypothesis testing.

## Conclusion

Understanding the business problem is a crucial step in finding solutions. Using the right framework, including understanding the background, setting objectives, identifying root causes, and writing hypotheses, can help identify important metrics to effectively address the problem. This enables the company to implement the appropriate strategy to reduce the attrition rate from 15% to 10% within a year.
